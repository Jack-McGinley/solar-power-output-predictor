# solar-power-output-predictor

Our program uses weather data provided by the National Solar Radiation Database (nsrdb) to create predictions of the power generated by a solar panel module. The main executable file allows the user to enter their own parameters for their solar panel module or use default values, and will generate a graph plotting the true power calculation using the weather data from the nsrdb, as well as generate a csv file containing the predicted power output from our machine learning model and the true calculated power output.
