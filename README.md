# solar-power-output-predictor

Our program uses weather data provided by the National Solar Radiation Database (nsrdb) to create predictions of the power generated by a solar panel module. The main.py executable file allows the user to enter their own parameters for their solar panel module or use default values, and will generate a configured csv file of the nrsdb datset from 2024, a graph plotting the true monthly average power output using the weather data from the configured nsrdb, and a csv file containing the predicted power output from our machine learning model and the true calculated power output. The predicted power output is found using a pytorch regression model, and uses the GHI metric from the nrsdb dataset to predict the power output. You can run the program by calling the main.py module. The nrsdb dataset can be found in the github. Ensure the csv file is within the same directory as the python files, and in the main.py module change the file path to the appropriate file path on your system to the csv file.
